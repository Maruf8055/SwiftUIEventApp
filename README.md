Problem Discovery:
While trying to discover local events, I realized that many people face difficulties in quickly finding, joining, and tracking events in their area. Many existing apps are either too cluttered or lack simple user flows for easy event management.

My Solution:
This SwiftUI Event Management App solves these issues by providing a simple, intuitive platform for users to browse and join local events. The app offers user authentication, event listings, and a custom calendar to track events. This approach allows users to easily keep their event plans organized.
